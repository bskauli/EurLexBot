The CSD operating the securities settlement system shall conclude the arrangements in a non-discriminatory manner and may charge a reasonable commercial fee based on actual costs. It shall deny such a request only where it considers that the arrangements would affect the smooth and orderly functioning of the financial markets or would pose a systemic risk. It shall not deny a request on the grounds of loss of market share. If it denies a request, it shall inform the operator of the DLT market infrastructure that made the request of its reasons in writing.\\n10.
