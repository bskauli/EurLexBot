                     <p class="oj-normal">Crowdfunding is increasingly an established form of alternative finance for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), typically relying on small investments. Crowdfunding represents an increasingly important type of intermediation where a crowdfunding service provider, without taking on own risk, operates a digital platform open to the public in order to match or facilitate the matching of prospective investors or lenders with businesses that seek funding. Such funding could take the form of loans or the acquisition of transferable securities or of other admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes. It is therefore appropriate to include within the scope of this Regulation both lending-based crowdfunding and investment-based crowdfunding, since those types of crowdfunding can be structured as comparable funding alternatives.</p>

Lack of access to finance for SMEs constitutes a problem even in those Member States where access to bank finance has remained stable throughout the financial crisis. Crowdfunding has emerged and become an established practice of funding business activities of natural and legal persons. Such funding takes place through online platforms; the business activities are typically funded by a large number of people or organisations; and the businesses, including business start-ups, raise relatively small amounts of money.</p>

In particular, the fact that the legal framework is fragmented along national borders creates substantial legal costs for retail investors who often face difficulties in determining the rules applicable to cross-border crowdfunding services. Therefore, such investors are often discouraged from investing cross-border by means of crowdfunding platforms. For the same reasons, crowdfunding service providers operating such platforms are discouraged from offering their services in Member States other than the one in which they are established. As a result, crowdfunding services have remained hitherto largely national, to the detriment of a Union-wide crowdfunding market, thus depriving businesses of access to crowdfunding services, especially in cases where those businesses operate in smaller national markets.</p>

Depending on the type of assets to be safe-kept, assets are either to be held in custody, as with transferable securities which can be registered in a financial instruments account or which can be physically delivered, or to be subject to ownership verification and record-keeping. Safekeeping of transferable securities or admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes that in accordance with national law are only registered with the project owner or its agent, such as investments in non-listed companies, or are held on an individually segregated account that a client could open directly with a central securities depository, is considered equivalent to asset safekeeping by qualified custodians.</p>

The key investment information sheet should also take into account, where available, the specific features and risks associated with project owners, and should focus on material information about the project owners, the investors' rights and fees, and the type of transferable securities, admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes and loans offered. The key investment information sheet should be drawn up by the project owners, because the project owners are in the best position to provide the information required to be included therein. However, since it is the crowdfunding service providers that are responsible for providing the key investment information sheet to prospective investors, it is the crowdfunding service providers that should ensure that the key investment information sheet is clear, correct and complete.</p>

The bulletin board provided by a crowdfunding service provider should therefore not consist of an internal matching system which executes client orders on a multilateral basis unless, in relation to transferable securities, the crowdfunding service provider also has a separate authorisation as an investment firm in accordance with Article 5 of Directive 2014/65/EU, or as a regulated market in accordance with Article 44 of that Directive. Crowdfunding service providers that do not hold such an authorisation in relation to transferable securities should clearly inform investors that they do not accept the reception of orders for the purposes of buying or selling contracts in relation to investments originally made on the crowdfunding platform, that any buying and selling activity on their crowdfunding platform is at the investor's discretion and responsibility, and that they do not operate a trading venue in accordance with Directive 2014/65/EU.</p>
