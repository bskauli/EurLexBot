However, as fundamental trade-offs involving credit risk and liquidity remain in a tokenised world, the success of token-based systems will depend on how well they interact with traditional account-based systems, at least in the interim.</p>

Currently, there is also a lack of authorised financial market infrastructures which use distributed ledger technology to provide trading or settlement services, or a combination of such services, for crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments. The development of a secondary market for such crypto-assets could bring multiple benefits, such as enhanced efficiency, transparency and competition in relation to trading and settlement activities.</p>

                     <p class="oj-normal">At the same time, regulatory gaps exist due to legal, technological and operational specificities related to the use of distributed ledger technology and to crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments. For instance, there are no transparency, reliability or safety requirements imposed on the protocols and ‘smart contracts’ that underpin crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments. The underlying technology could also raise some novel forms of risk that are not adequately addressed by the existing rules. Several projects for the trading of crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments and related post-trading services and activities have been developed in the Union, but few are already in operation, and those that are in operation are of limited scale. Furthermore, as highlighted by the European Central Bank’s (ECB) Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral and its Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Payments, the use of distributed ledger technology would entail similar challenges to those faced by conventional technology, such as fragmentation and interoperability issues, and would potentially also create new issues, for instance in relation to the legal validity of tokens. Given the limited experience as regards the trading of crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments and related post-trading services and activities, it is currently premature to significantly modify Union financial services legislation to enable the full deployment of such crypto-assets and their underlying technology. At the same time, the creation of financial market infrastructure for crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments is currently constrained by requirements embedded in Union financial services legislation that are not well suited to crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments or the use of distributed ledger technology. For instance, platforms for trading crypto-assets usually give direct access to retail investors, whereas traditional trading venues usually give access to retail investors only through financial intermediaries.</p>

The pilot regime should allow for certain DLT market infrastructures to be temporarily exempted from some of the specific requirements of Union financial services legislation that could otherwise prevent operators from developing solutions for the trading and settlement of transactions in crypto-assets that qualify as financial instruments, without weakening any existing requirements or safeguards applied to traditional market infrastructures. DLT market infrastructures and their operators should have in place adequate safeguards related to the use of distributed ledger technology to ensure the effective protection of investors, including clearly defined chains of liability to clients for any losses due to operational failures. The pilot regime should also enable the European Supervisory Authority (European Securities and Markets Authority) established by Regulation (EU) No 1095/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc11-L_2022151EN.01000101-E0011" href="#ntr11-L_2022151EN.01000101-E0011"

However, the combination of trading and post-trading activities within a single entity is not envisaged by the existing rules, irrespective of the technology used, due to policy choices related to risk specialisation and unbundling for the purposes of encouraging competition. The pilot regime should not be a precedent to justify a fundamental overhaul of the separation of trading and post-trading activities or of the landscape of financial market infrastructures. However, in view of the potential benefits of distributed ledger technology in terms of combining trading and settlement, it is justified to provide for a dedicated DLT market infrastructure in the pilot regime, namely, the DLT TSS, which combines the activities normally performed by multilateral trading facilities and securities settlement systems.</p>

A credit institution authorised under Directive 2013/36/EU that provides investment services or performs investment activities should only be allowed to operate a DLT TSS when authorised as an investment firm or market operator under Directive 2014/65/EU. An investment firm or market operator operating a DLT TSS should be subject to the requirements that apply to a DLT MTF, and a CSD operating a DLT TSS should be subject to the requirements that apply to a DLT SS. Since a DLT TSS would enable an investment firm or market operator also to provide settlement services, and would enable a CSD also to provide trading services, it is necessary that investment firms or market operators also comply with the requirements that apply to a DLT SS, and that CSDs comply with the requirements that apply to a DLT MTF. Since CSDs are not subject to certain authorisation and organisational requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU when providing investment services or activities in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, it is appropriate to take a similar approach in the pilot regime both for investment firms and market operators and for CSDs operating a DLT TSS. Therefore, an investment firm or market operator operating a DLT TSS should be exempted from a limited set of authorisation and organisational requirements under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, since the investment firm or market operator will be required to comply with the authorisation and organisational requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU. Conversely, a CSD operating a DLT TSS should be exempted from a limited set of authorisation and organisational requirements under Directive 2014/65/EU, since the CSD will be required to comply with the authorisation and organisational requirements under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014. Such exemptions should be temporary and should not apply to a DLT market infrastructure operating outside the pilot regime. ESMA should be able to assess technical standards on record-keeping and operational risks adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 with a view to ensuring that they are applied proportionately to investment firms or market operators operating a DLT TSS.</p>

By contrast, many platforms for trading crypto-assets offer disintermediated access and provide direct access for retail investors. Accordingly, one potential regulatory obstacle to the development of multilateral trading facilities for DLT financial instruments could be the obligation of intermediation under Directive 2014/65/EU. At the request of an operator of a DLT MTF, the competent authority should therefore be allowed to grant a temporary exemption from that obligation of intermediation in order to provide direct access for retail investors and to enable them to deal on their own account, provided that adequate safeguards regarding investor protection are in place, that such retail investors fulfil certain conditions and that the operator complies with any possible additional investor protection measures that the competent authority requires. Retail investors that have direct access to a DLT MTF as members or participants under an exemption from the obligation of intermediation should not be considered to be investment firms within the meaning of Directive 2014/65/EU solely by virtue of being members of, or participants in, a DLT MTF.</p>

For instance, exemptions should be possible to the extent that the rules of that Regulation applicable to CSDs and which refer to the terms ‘dematerialised form’, ‘securities account’ or ‘transfer orders’ do not apply to CSDs operating a DLT SS, with the exception of the requirements for CSD links which should apply <span class="oj-italic">mutatis mutandis</span>. With respect to the term ‘securities account’, the exemption would cover the rules on the recording of securities, integrity of issue and segregation of accounts. Whereas CSDs operate securities settlement systems by crediting and debiting the securities accounts of their participants, double-entry or multiple-entry book keeping securities accounts might not always be feasible in a DLT SS. Therefore, an exemption should also be possible for a CSD operating a DLT SS from the rules in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 that refer to the term ‘book-entry form’ where such an exemption is necessary to allow for the recording of DLT financial instruments on a distributed ledger. However, a CSD operating a DLT SS should still ensure the integrity of the DLT financial instruments issue on the distributed ledger and the segregation of the DLT financial instruments belonging to the various participants.</p>

Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 only permits CSDs operating a DLT SS to outsource a core service or activity after receiving authorisation from the competent authority. A CSD operating a DLT SS should therefore be able to request an exemption from that authorisation requirement where the CSD demonstrates that the requirement is incompatible with the use of distributed ledger technology as envisaged in its business plan.

Accordingly, an operator of a securities settlement system based on distributed ledger technology that requests to be exempted from the participation requirements of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 would as a result not comply with the participation requirements of Directive 98/26/EC. Consequently, that securities settlement system cannot be designated and notified under that Directive and for that reason is not referred to as a ‘DLT securities settlement system’ in this Regulation but rather as a DLT SS. This Regulation should allow a CSD to operate a DLT SS that does not qualify as a securities settlement system designated under Directive 98/26/EC, and an exemption from the rules on settlement finality in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be available, subject to certain compensatory measures, including specific compensatory measures to mitigate risks arising from insolvency, as insolvency protection measures under Directive 98/26/EC do not apply.

Where the settlement of cash payments in central bank money is not practical and available, it should be possible for settlement to take place through the CSD’s own accounts in accordance with that Regulation or through accounts opened with a credit institution (‘commercial bank money’). That rule can be difficult to apply for a CSD operating a DLT SS, however, because the CSD would have to effect movements in cash accounts at the same time as the delivery of securities recorded on the distributed ledger. A temporary exemption should therefore be allowed for CSDs operating a DLT SS from the provision of that Regulation on cash settlement in order to develop innovative solutions under the pilot regime by facilitating access to commercial bank money, or the use of ‘e-money tokens’.

In particular, the regulatory technical standards under Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 relating to certain data reporting requirements and pre- and post-trade transparency requirements are not well adapted to financial instruments issued by means of distributed ledger technology. Secondary markets in financial instruments issued by means of distributed ledger technology or similar technology are still nascent and therefore their features potentially differ from markets in financial instruments using traditional technology. The rules set out in those regulatory technical standards should apply to all financial instruments, regardless of the technology used. Therefore, in line with existing mandates in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 to develop draft regulatory technical standards, ESMA should carry out a comprehensive assessment of those regulatory technical standards and propose any necessary amendment to ensure that the rules set out therein could be effectively applied to DLT financial instruments. In carrying out that assessment, ESMA should take into account the specificities of DLT financial instruments and whether they require standards to be adapted to allow for the development of those financial instruments without undermining the objectives of the rules laid down in the regulatory technical standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 600/2014.</p>

The period during which a CCP or a trading venue could be exempted by its competent authority in respect of exchange-traded derivatives from the rules on non-discriminatory access expired on 3 July 2020. The increased uncertainty and volatility of the markets negatively impacted the operational risks of CCPs and trading venues and, therefore, the date of application of the new open-access regime for CCPs and trading venues offering trading and clearing services in respect of exchange-traded derivatives was postponed by Article 95 of Regulation (EU) 2021/23 of the European Parliament and of the Council <a id="ntc16-L_2022151EN.01000101-E0016" href="#ntr16-L_2022151EN.01000101-E0016"

Furthermore, the open-access regime could run counter to parallel policy objectives to foster trading and innovation within the Union, since it could disincentivise innovation in exchange-traded derivatives by allowing competitors, who are beneficiaries of open access, to rely on incumbents’ infrastructure and investments in order to offer competing products with low upfront costs. Maintaining a system whereby derivatives are cleared and traded in a vertically integrated entity is also consistent with long-standing international trends. The date of application of the new open-access regime should therefore be postponed by two more years, until 3 July 2023.</p>

The settlement discipline regime comprises rules for the reporting of settlement fails, the collection and distribution of cash penalties and mandatory buy-ins. Pursuant to regulatory technical standards adopted under Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, the provisions on settlement discipline apply from 1 February 2022. However, stakeholders have provided evidence that mandatory buy-ins could increase liquidity pressure and the costs of securities at risk of being bought in. Such impact could be further exacerbated in cases of market volatility. Against that background, applying the rules on mandatory buy-ins as laid down in Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 could have a negative impact on the efficiency and competitiveness of capital markets in the Union. That impact could in turn lead to wider bid-offer spreads, reduced market efficiency and reduced incentives to lend securities in the securities lending and repo markets and to settle transactions with CSDs established in the Union. The costs of applying the rules on mandatory buy-ins are, therefore, expected to outweigh the potential benefits. Taking into account that potential negative impact, Regulation (EU) No 909/2014 should be amended to allow for a different date of application for each settlement discipline measure, so that the date of application of the rules on mandatory buy-ins can be further postponed. That postponement would allow the Commission to assess, within the context of the forthcoming legislative proposal reviewing Regulation (EU) No 909/2014, how the settlement discipline framework, and in particular the rules on mandatory buy-ins, should be amended to take into account and address the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, such postponement would ensure that market participants, including those DLT market infrastructures that would be subject to the settlement discipline regime, do not incur implementation costs twice in the event that those rules are amended as a result of the review of Regulation (EU) No 909/2014.</p>
